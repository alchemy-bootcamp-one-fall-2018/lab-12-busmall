User: The user wants the process to be as fast and painless as possible.  The more clicks they have to make, the worse.  They want to be able to instantly tell what they are looking at so they can move on to the next thing immediately.  Have some positive reinforcement involved.

Marketing Team:  They want the results of all the clicks - which one was clicked the most and what percentage of the time.  They want the total number of clicks.  They want to know how many times each item was displayed and how often it was clicked. 

Developer:  Try to adhere to our guidelines as much as possible.  We can't show the the results until the user has clicked 25 images.

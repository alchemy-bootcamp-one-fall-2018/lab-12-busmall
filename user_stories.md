1. **As a market researcher, I want:** to have the participant presented with *three randomly selected images at a time*, so they can *click on their one favorite*, *have it recorded*, and then be presented with *another set of three randomly selected images*, and so on until they have selected a favorite from *25 sets of images*. I then want to present the magazine owner with a *user-summary page*, showing *# of votes for each item by name* (as well as how many *times each was presented as an option*) along with *each item's percentage* (weighted result).

2. **As a focus group participant, I want:** to clearly *view three images at a time* and *be able to select one*, *have it recorded*, and be *presented with three new images*, until they researchers are done (after I have selected from *25 sets of images*).

3. **As the publisher of BusMall magazine, I want:** to not have the user data tainted by too much information too soon (i.e. *don't show them any tallies until all 25 sets have been selected*), and have an accurate tally not only of the *# of times each item is selected*, but see that information in *% form* to give the selections the proper weight.

<!-- User Stories
As a x, I want y, so that z.

Try to write as many user stories as you can for each role. DO THIS STEP FIRST in a file called user_stories.md. -->

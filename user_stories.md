# BusMall App: Focus Group Survey

## User Stories

### Marketing Team
1) As the marketing director, I need to know which products are more attractive to individuals and thus have a higher chance of being purchased, so I can include them in our product catalog.

2) As the marketing analyzer, I want to see a breakdown of data showing products by their popularity, so I can illustrate that data in charts and graphs for the rest of my team.

### Developer
1) As the developer, I want to build an app that is easy enough to use, so that focus group participants can select 1 out of 3 images at a time in order to make 25 total image selections.

2) As the developer, I want to store, calculate, and visually display resulting data to the Focus Group user, so they can see their results after completing the survey.

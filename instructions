products.api -- getAll() --> product-app.js
                    ||
                    \/
                display.js

Pull full list of products from products api
Pick 3 random items
Hand 3 items to display.js
display.js tells product-app which item was clicked
all three items are then "spliced" into the "hold array"
after a new product is clicked, those three items will "pop" back to the splice array and the new three items will replace them

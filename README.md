# BusMall Market Analysis App

#### By Cari Palazzolo

## Description

In this lab, I'm building an app that displays potential products to individuals in focus groups in order to test their potential customer appeal. The focus group users will choose which product out of three that they would be most likely to purchase, until they have made 25 image selections. As they progress through the app it will store, calculate, and visually display the resulting data.

Data to consider:
- Total number of clicks
- Total number of times each image displays
- Percentage of times that an item was clicked when it was shown

## Initial work:
* Write user stories: `"As a x, I want y, so that z."`
    - Roles:
        - Marketing team, in need of data
            - Unique perspectives per team member
        - Focus group user, using app
            - Different perspectives per user
* Create UI mockup
* Determine component architecture

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* TBD...

## Technologies Used

* Vanilla JavaScript, HTML, CSS

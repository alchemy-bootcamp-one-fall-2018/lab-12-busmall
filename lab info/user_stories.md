1. As a focus group participant, I need to be able to see a visual representation of 3 different BusMall products so I can choose 1 product that I would be most likely to purchase of the 3 options.

2. As a marketing research team member, I need to be able to look at the survey data (each product's views and clicks) and be able to determine which are our "top" products from our list of 25 and would be most likely to sell. 

3. As a marketing research team member, I need to make sure that the focus group participants cannot see the other votes from prior participants so that their picks are unaffected by other peoples' opinions.

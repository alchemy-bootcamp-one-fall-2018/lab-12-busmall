As a market researcher, the goal is to have users click on images of products they like best out of the the three random images that displays. The goal is that at the end of a round, once an image has reached 25 clicks, the voting ends and the results should show which products get the most clicks

As an advertising exec, the results of most clicked images should indicate which products are most popular and marketable.

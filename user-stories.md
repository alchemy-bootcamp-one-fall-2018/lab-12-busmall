As a _x_, I want _y_, so that _z_.

As a busy adult, I want to be part of a focus group to earn 
some cash.

As an online shopper, I want to see what products are being
considered by retailers, for a chance to have my opinion heard.

As part of the marketing research team, I want fast and
accurate data to aide me in determining our final product 
offering.

As a connoisseur of rare and mythical animal meats, I want to 
spend less time searching for a reliable source of quality 
meats from a single location.

As a stay-at-home parent, I want to find inexpensive, time 
saving household products so I can smell wine from a glass you 
can't drink from while my baby and dog clean all the floors.
